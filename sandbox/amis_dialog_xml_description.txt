	lists of captions for populating an inner list
	switches which wrap captions or descriptions
	
the list element wraps
	caption and/or description
	it can be repeatable or not, meaning that the list's contents (max 1 caption + 1 description) will apply for each list item, or they will be inserted into the list one at a time (in this case, no max)
	
A caption / description has..
	text
	audio
		or
	a promptItem reference (points to text and audio)
		or 
	a prompt (has promptItems and promptVar's in it)
		or
	a single promptVar
	
Text
	is raw text
Audio
	has an src
	
A prompt item has..
	text
	audio
		or
	a refid pointing to a promptitem (which is assumed to have content and not another pointer)

A prompt variable is...
	a context-specific variable which will resolve to
		a text/audio par
			or
		text only
			which can then be resolved into:
				text + TTS at runtime
					or
				text + pre-recorded audio (matched at runtime .. like a text value of "1" = "one.mp3")
