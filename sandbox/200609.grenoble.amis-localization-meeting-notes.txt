Next meeting about this: first week in Oct

DECISIONS:
	* SF or DFA site -->SF	
	* Python or Perl -->Python
	* Which XML Lib	 -->XML Lib
	* Where to upload audio (SF or DFA-public)	-->  public upload to anonymous DFA FTP

IMMEDIATE TODO:
	* Port existing webapp scripts to Python
	* Is libxslt installed for Python on SF?
			We can do xslt transformations on the client instead	
	* Install DB for user logins	
			The table "users" has these fields:
			 username      | varchar(20) 
			 realname      | varchar(100)
			 password      | varchar(20) 
			 email         | varchar(50)
			 langid        | varchar(6) 
			 lang_name     | varchar(50)
			 last_login    | datetime 
			 last_activity | datetime
			 is_logged_in  | tinyint(4)
			 
	* Create the FTP space on DFA	
			login access in /pub/incoming/do_not_touch_this_folder	
			u/p: amisl10nweb/amisl10nweb

NEW SCRIPTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING SCRIPTS
	* Login and timeout
			MySQL: table for logins/timeouts
	* Page display and filtering (Webapp scripts might need some tweaks)
	* Uploading XML and audio (esp audio FTP)
	* Email notifications
	* Adding or removing XML items based on changes made to the English XML file				

A. TRANSLATION

1. user logs in
	* How to do a timeout on the user login?  Many users might try to log in at the same time.
	* An idea: if no activity for 10? min, ask the user if they want to continue working; if no response, log out after 60 seconds.  	
	* a language is pre-associated with a user account
2. the first of several pages of prompts are displayed
3. the page can be filtered:
	a. show all
	b. show untranslated
	c. show flagged
4. the page can be printed
5. the user works and saves, often, as they proceed through the pages
	a. text is typed
	b. audio is uploaded
6. when everything is done (no untranslated items or flags left), an email is sent to me			
	* should I get an email when a language starts?  for any activity?  should i be able to turn on/off monitoring of specific languages?
	

B. UPDATES to the XML files
1. I decide to add a new item
2. I make the appropriate changes in the RC template by hand
3. I change the english XML file by hand
4. I have a manual script to make the corresponding changes in the other XML files
	* The translators also receive an autogenerated email that there are new items
5. When the translator logs in again, there are a bunch of new untranslated items

	
The FUTURE:

1. Translate the help file in an easier way (people have trouble with the HTML editing)
2. Provide a "download script" link so that all the prompts (maybe a filtered list too) can be HTML-ized for ease of use with a recording tool
	* be sure to metion that the HTML doc is READ ONLY!!!
3. Provide an "upload prompts book" link to auto-reinsert audio prompts from a DTB source (script already exists)
4. update the help DTBs when the accessible UI file changes
