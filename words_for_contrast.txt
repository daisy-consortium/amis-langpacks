The AMIS full installer can substitute a different word for "contrast" for the CSS files.  The filename then appears in the menu of AMIS.  
However, the filename must be ASCII.  Tests with non-ASCII filenames have not been done yet.  It would depend on how IE treats local CSS references -- do they have to conform to URL requirements or not?
