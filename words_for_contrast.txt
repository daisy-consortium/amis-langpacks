The AMIS full installer can substitute a different word for "contrast" for the CSS files.  The filename then appears in the menu of AMIS.  
However, the filename must be ASCII.  Tests with non-ASCII filenames have not been done yet.  It would depend on how IE treats local CSS references -- do they have to conform to URL requirements or not?

We should be able to collect and use data for these languages:
eng-US    English (United States) "Contrast"
eng-AU    Australian English "Contrast"
fra-FR    French             "contraste"
