AMIS Localization

Instructions for text translation
===
The important files you get are:

1. amisAccessibleUi.pdf [PDF of all UI items]
2. amisAccessibleUi.xml [XML document of all UI items; you may not need this file, depending on the option you choose]
2. help\helpFileTemplate.html [HTML version of the help file]
3. start\amis-splash-screen.html [HTML version of the splash screen]screen]

===
The major steps are:

1. Translate the user interface (UI) items.

UI items are things like menus, dialogs, and buttons.  Each has a short label, which will appear on screen in AMIS, and a longer description, which is used to give AMIS more accessibility options.

Note!  If you would rather enter your data directly via a computer interface, you can skip this step in favor of using the online web interface (this will be available very soon - check http://amis.sf.net for more information).  If you prefer to work with pen-and-paper before entering data into the computer, the PDF file has been included as a print-out convenience.

The text strings of these items are listed in included PDF file.  Each item that needs to be translated is followed by one or several blank lines.  Print out the PDF file and write the translation on the blank line.  Do not translate the colons (e.g., "File:______" means that you translate the word "File" but not "File:").

If you are comfortable editing XML directly, you can skip the PDF and translate the XML file instead.  Please see the document "amis_xml_translation_instructions.txt" for instructions.

2.Translate the help file and the splash screen

Input the translation directly in the HTML file.  Be sure to also translate alt-text for images.  Use a text editor to do your work.  Use a Unicode font if possible.  STAY AWAY from graphical HTML tools like Front Page, PageMaker, MS Word, etc.  They cannot be trusted to preserve encodings or markup.

There are blocks of HTML which do not require translation.  This is noted in comments, which are formatted like this:
<!--this line is a comment-->

Send/submit all files when the translation is complete.  Then you will be sent or given back Sigtuna DAR projects for recording.  Please wait for this step: the process requires that we do some magic to the files before they are recorded.  Don't record until you get your Sigtuna projects.

3. Please supply us with the text for the name of your language, a flag or iconic representation, and an audio recording of the name of your language.  These should go in small stand-alone files: 1 unicode text file, 1 mp3 file, and 1 image file.


Please email any questions to the address given below.  All inquiries welcome.
